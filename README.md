# Pig game
Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by [John Scarne in 1945][1] 
This version is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScritp.

# The rules
This is a modified version that uses two dices instead of one. Now, let's be familiar with the game rules:
1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
3. If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
5. The first player to reach 100 points (by default) on GLOBAL score wins the game. The user can change the GLOBAL score in the tab "FINAL SCORE"
6. Enjoy :)
